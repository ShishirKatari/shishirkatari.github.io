This article consists of why I cant choose a topic for an article which I have to write for.
I rack up my brains for a minute and finally find something which is spider webs….JK
My brain functions very well in normal situations when its normal but if it’s a situation….My brain goes to ALT+f4. Well I admit I find a topic to write using this but I cant survive everyday using this explanation of my brain stops working saga. Well that does not wrap up my article cos I have a ot to write but shojshiuqbew;ijcbsidubc;iusdgrhbsegflhjersbluyegfvbsefiugvci there we go that ends it :)..
